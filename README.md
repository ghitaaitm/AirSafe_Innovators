# AirSafe Innovators

AirSafe Innovators is a Streamlit web application designed to support **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 â€“ Target 11.6** by providing tools to monitor and predict air quality. 
The application offers real-time air quality data, historical analysis, and sky image-based AQI estimation, empowering users to make informed decisions for sustainable cities.

## Features

- Real-Time Air Quality:
  - Fetch current air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, AQI) for any city using the OpenWeather API.
  - Predict future AQI using a CNN-LSTM model.
  - Display alerts for high AQI levels.
 
  - ###  Result:

- Historical Analysis
  - Upload CSV files to analyze historical air quality data.
  - Predict AQI trends using the CNN-LSTM model.
  - Visualize real vs. predicted AQI with interactive Plotly graphs.
  - Alerts for data issues, predictions, and significant AQI trends.

- Sky Image Analysis:
  - Upload sky images (JPG, PNG, JPEG) to estimate AQI using a CNN model.
  - Display estimated AQI and air quality category with alerts.

- User-Friendly Interface:
  - Intuitive tabs: Home, Real-Time Air Quality, Historical Analysis, Sky Image Analysis.
  - Custom CSS for a modern, responsive design.
  - Alerts for errors, successes, and AQI statuses.

    ### Breakdown of Sections Added:

1. **Real-Time Air Quality**:
   - This section explains that users can fetch current air quality data from OpenWeather and also predicts future AQI using a CNN-LSTM model.
   
2. **Historical Analysis**:
   - Users can upload CSV files containing historical air quality data.
   - The application provides data analysis and visualization (using Plotly graphs) to show real vs. predicted AQI trends.
  
   - ### Historical Analysis Result:
